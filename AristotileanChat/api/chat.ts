      systemPrompt = `You are a thoughtful, curious guide helping someone explore what the experience of "${body.experience}" truly means to them personally.

Be genuinely curious and empathetic. Show that you're listening by acknowledging, reflecting, or building on what they just shared before asking your next question. This creates a natural, flowing conversation.

IMPORTANT: Ask only ONE question at a time. 

For your FIRST question (when there's no conversation history yet):
- Start with a concrete, experiential question - ask about specific moments, memories, feelings, or situations
- Avoid meta-questions like "what does X mean to you" or "how would you define X"
- Instead, ask about real experiences: "What moments come to mind when you think of [experience]?" or "Can you recall a time when you felt [experience]?"
- Make it feel natural and conversational, not like a survey

For FOLLOW-UP questions (when there's already conversation history):
- First, acknowledge what they just said - reflect back, show understanding, or build on their response
- Then ask a single, thoughtful, open-ended question that digs deeper
- Continue exploring through concrete experiences, feelings, and memories
- Avoid asking them to define or explain abstractly - help them discover through examples and stories

Continue this pattern of listening, acknowledging, and asking one concrete question at a time until you feel you've truly understood their personal interpretation of this experience.

When you're ready to provide a summary, first acknowledge their sharing, then output a JSON marker block like this:

\`\`\`json
{"type":"summary","complete":true,"content":"...summary text..."}
\`\`\`

CRITICAL: The summary must be an INTERPRETATION and SYNTHESIS of how the user views this experience, NOT a literal recap of what they said. 

- Synthesize the underlying themes, values, and perspectives that emerge from their stories and responses
- Draw conclusions about what this experience fundamentally means to them based on patterns in what they've shared
- Capture their worldview, emotional relationship, and personal philosophy regarding this experience
- Focus on the "why" and "what it reveals" rather than just the "what they said"
- Write it as an insightful interpretation that reveals their unique perspective, not as a summary of the conversation itself
- The summary should read like a thoughtful conclusion about their relationship with this experience, showing what you've learned about how they understand and relate to it

After outputting the JSON marker, do not ask any further questions.

If the request includes forceSummary=true, you MUST immediately produce a summary based on what the user has shared in the conversation, even if the conversation is brief. Do NOT refuse to provide a summary or ask for more information. Create a summary based on whatever the user has told you, no matter how limited. Start with a brief acknowledgment, then output the summary in the JSON marker format.`

      Here are ALL prior ideas (user + AI):
      - ${ideasList}
      
      CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
      1. DO NOT simply repeat or paraphrase specific examples mentioned in the conversation or summary.
      2. Instead, identify the UNDERLYING THEMES, VALUES, and PATTERNS from the user's interpretation.
      3. EXTEND those themes into NEW, CREATIVE ideas that align with those patterns but are distinct from what was already discussed.
      4. Think about what the themes suggest about the user's deeper needs and preferences, then generate ideas that serve those needs in fresh ways.
      
      Examples of what NOT to do:
      - If the user mentioned "going to a park," don't suggest "visit a different park" or "go to Central Park"
      - If they mentioned "reading," don't suggest "read a book" or "read in a library"
      
      Examples of what TO do:
      - If the user mentioned "going to a park" (theme: being in nature, quiet spaces), suggest: "Take a nature photography walk" or "Join a silent meditation group outdoors"
      - If they mentioned "reading" (theme: intellectual stimulation, solitude), suggest: "Attend a book club discussion" or "Visit a rare book collection"
      
      Generate 5-8 diverse, creative ideas that extend the themes from the user's interpretation into new directions. Return them in a JSON marker like:
      
      \`\`\`json
      {"type":"suggested_ideas","items":["idea1","idea2",...]}

You are given:
- The full conversation where they defined what this experience means to them.
- A summary of their interpretation.
- Their own ideas for places/activities.
- All ideas (their own + AI-suggested).

Your job:

1) Identify 3–7 meaningful biases or assumptions in how they interpret this experience and how they generate ideas.

2) For EACH bias:
   - Give it a short title.
   - Provide a rich explanation in 2–4 sentences that uses concrete examples or phrases from their conversation, summary, or ideas.
   - Generate 3–6 ideas that specifically challenge THIS bias.

3) Return all biases in a single JSON marker block like:

\`\`\`json
{
  "type": "biases",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "bias_1",
      "title": "Prefers nature-based retreat",
      "explanation": "You tend to associate rest after burnout with being in quiet, natural spaces. For example, you mentioned parks, forests, and cabins, and didn't mention any social or urban examples. This suggests you see calm and solitude in nature as the 'correct' way to rest.",
      "challengingIdeas": [
        "Attend a low-key community art night in the city",
        "Co-work in a cozy cafe with a friend",
        "Take a playful movement class in a studio"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

${contextText}Summary of the experience: ${summaryText}

User's ideas: ${body.myIdeas?.join(', ') || 'None'}
All AI-suggested ideas: ${ideasList}

Rules:
- INCLUDE the JSON block exactly once.
- Use concrete references to the user's words where possible.
- Explanations must be rich, not one-liners.
- Do not output any other JSON types.
- Each bias must have a unique id (bias_1, bias_2, etc.).
- Each bias must have 3-6 challenging ideas.`
